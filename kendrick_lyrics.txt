promise that you will sing about mei said when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about mei woke up this morning and figured id call you
in case im not here tomorrow im hoping that i can borrow
a peace of mind im behind on whats really important
my mind is really distorted i find nothing but trouble in my life
im fortunate you believe in a dream
this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
and last night was just another distraction or a reaction
of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened
you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up
but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
as blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive
everybodys a victim in my eyes
when i ride its a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
a demon glued to my back whispering get em
i got em and i aint give a fuck
that same mentality that told my brother not to duck
in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors
i wonder if ill ever discover a passion like you and recover
the life that i knew as a youngn in pajamas and duntaduns
when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
dumb niggas like me never prosper
prognosis of a problem child im proud and well devoted
this piru shit been in me forever
so forever imma push it wherever whenever
and i love you cause you love my brother like you did
just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big
and if i die before your album drop i hope gunshotspromise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
you wrote a song about my sister on your tape
and called it section80 the message resembled brendas got a baby
whats crazy was i was hearing about it
but doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
judging her past and shit well its completely my future
her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
and imma need that forty dollars even if i gotta
fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot
gonzales park im followed by a married man a father of three
my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keys
matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with es
he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week
this is the life of another girl damaged by the system
these foster homes i run away and never do miss em
see my hormones just run away and if i can get em back
to where they used to be then ill probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin
then you probably need to beat her thats how i was taught
three niggas in one room first time i was tossed
and im exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit
my sister died in vain but what point are you trying to gain
if you cant fit the pumps i walk in ill wait
your rebuttal a little too late
and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song
cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great
a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight
ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
ill never fade away ill never fade away i know my fate
and im on the grind for this cake imma get it or die trying
im eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
you lying to these motherfuckers talking about you can help em
with my story you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga
dont ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga
when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
sometimes i look in a mirror and ask myself
am i really scared of passing away if its today i hope i hear a
cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
with the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of jesus
i wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
reeking the scent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon and if im doomed
may the womb help my mother be blessed for many moons
i suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror
get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots
and im not sure why im infatuated with death
my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful
and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
maybe cause im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
really stuck in the schema of wondering when imma rest
and youre right your brother was a brother to me
and your sisters situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak of something thats realer than the tv screen
by any means wasnt trying to offend or come between
her personal life i was like it need to be told
cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul
exactly whatd happen if i aint continued rappin
or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
fives i count lives all on these songs
look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong
fighting for your rights even when youre wrong
and hope that at least one of you sing about me when im gone
am i worth it
did i put enough work in
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about mepromise that youll sing about me forever
promise that youll sing about me forooooh
promise that youll sing about me forever
promise that youll sing about me forooooh
promise that youll sing about me forever

and if you riding with me nigga let me ask this question niggai remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in the hotel room
i didnt wanna self destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
but that didnt stop survivors guilt
going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned
or maybe how a1 my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city i was entering a new one
a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned
the word was respect
just because you wore a different gang color than mines
doesnt mean i cant respect you as a black man
forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
but i dont know im no mortal man maybe im just another niggashit and thats all i wrote
i was gonna call it another nigga but it aint really a poem i just felt like its something you probably could relate to other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa about a metaphor actually you spoke on the ground what you mean bout that what the ground representthe ground is gonna open up and swallow the evilrightthats how i see it my word is bond i seeand the ground is the symbol for the poor people the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people cause the rich people gonna be so fat they gonna be so appetising you know what im saying wealthy appetising the poor gonna be so poor and hungry you know what im saying its gonna be like there might be some cannibalism out this mutha they might eat the richaight so let me ask you this then do you see yourself as somebody thats rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunitiesi see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of the word i took nothin i took the opportunities i worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it i went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company i changed everything i realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what im saying i made myself a millionaire i made millions for a lot of people now its time to make millions for myself you know what im saying i made millions for the record companies i made millions for these movie companies now i make millions for usand through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanityby my faith in god by my faith in the game and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true you know what im saying and it was happening to me for a reason you know what im saying i was noticing shit i was punching the right buttons and it was happening so its no problem you know i mean its a problem but im not finna let them know im finna go straight throughwould you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wallshit i like to think that at every opportunity ive ever been threatened with resistance its been met with resistance and not only me but it goes down my family tree you know what im saying its in my veins to fight backaight well how long you think it take before niggas be like we fighting a war im fighting a war i cant win and i wanna lay it all downin this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength and thats right now while you a teenager while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back cause once you turn 30 its like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man in this country and you dont wanna fight no more and if you dont believe me you can look around you dont see no loud mouth 30year old muthafuckasthats crazy because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that theres nothing but turmoil goin on so i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation todayi think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores and next time its a riot theres gonna be like uh bloodshed for real i dont think america know that i think american think we was just playing and its gonna be some more playing but it aint gonna be no playing its gonna be murder you know what im saying its gonna be like nat turner 1831 up in this muthafucka you know what im saying its gonna happenthats crazy man in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lotta people dont understand how important it is sometimes i be like get behind a mic and i dont know what type of energy imma push out or where it comes from trip me out sometimesbecause the spirits we aint even really rappin we just letting our dead homies tell stories for usdamni wanted to read one last thing to you its actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world it saysthe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city
while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly
the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar
but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
he can no longer see past his own thoughts
hes trapped
when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
the result
wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle
although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the samewhats your perspective on that

everyone deserves a night to play play
and she plays only when you tell her noif these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when im in it i love it when im in itif these walls could talk theyd tell me to swim good
no boat i float better than he would
no life jacket im not the god of nazareth
but your flood can be misunderstood
walls telling me they full of pain resentment
need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
me im just a tenant
landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
these walls are vulnerable exclamation
interior pink color coordinated
i interrogated every nook and cranny
i mean its still amazing before they couldnt stand me
these walls want to cry tears
these walls happier when im here
these walls never could hold up
every time i come around demolition might crushif these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when im in it i love it when im in itif these walls could talk theyd tell me to go deep
yelling at me continuously i can see
your defense mechanism is my decision
knock these walls down thats my religion
walls feeling like they ready to close in
i suffocate then catch my second wind
i resonate in these walls
i dont know how long i can wait in these walls
ive been on the streets too long
looking at you from the outside in
they sing the same old song
about how they walls always the cleanest
i beg to differ i mustve missed them
im not involved id rather diss them
id rather call on you put your wall up
cause when i come around demolition gon crush
if these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when im in it i love it when im in itif your walls could talk theyd tell you its too late
your destiny accepted your fate
burn accessories and stash them where they are
take the recipe the bible and god
wall telling you that commissary is low
race wars happening no calling co
no calling your mother to save you
homies to say youre reputable not acceptable
your behavior is sammy da bull like
a killer that turned snitch
walls is telling me you a bitch
you pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
that sentence so important
walls telling you to listen to sing about me
retaliation is strong you even dream bout me
killed my homeboy and god spared your life
dumb criminal got indicted same night
so when you play this song rewind the first verse
about me abusing my power so you can hurt
about me and her in the shower whenever she horny
about me and her in the after hours of the morning
about her baby daddy currently serving life
and how she think about you until we meet up at night
about the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
and how she fucking on a famous rapper
walls could talki remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in a hotel roomwe on

i burst in the crowd with a voice and crown
im a king on the prowl and i see mama smile
and i vow on the tape that ill never break
you can break bread with me now
we can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
and walked that milein the darkness i often sit back
and get lost in the rap that i wrote
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
i was talking to you
i was walking it through every ghetto
tell success hello
we hereand im so happy i cry
cause i cant believe
all the things i ever wanted
are finally happening for me

or tell georgia state marcus garvey got all the answers
or try to celebrate february like its my bday
or eat watermelon chicken and koolaid on weekdays
or jump high enough to get michael jordan endorsements
or watch bet cause urban support is important
so why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street
when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me

i used to be jealous of arron afflalo
he was the one to follow
he was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
he would live in the gym
we was living in sorrow
total envy of him
he made a dream become a reality
actually making it possible to swim
his way out of compton with further more to accomplish
graduate with honors a sponsor of basketball scholars
its 2004 and im watching him score 30
remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
that we was just moving backwards
the bungalow where you find us
the art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
stick my head inside the study hall he focused on math
determination ambition plus dedication and wisdom
qualities he was given was the shit we didnt have
dug inside of his book bag and coach palmer asked for his finals
he had his back like a spinal meanwhile
we singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
11 graders gone wrong
he focused on the nba we focused on some patron
now watch that black boy flyblack boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boyi used to jealous of jayceon
i used to jealous of jayceon taylor when i was young
taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
a buick had driven past bumping him when i mowed the lawn
money laundering hustling homies pondering up against
schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
wars the case and just in case you wasnt alarmed
the city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
its 2004 and im hearing the people roar
for the name of the game they line in front of the store
swap meets selling our mixtapes im like oh shit wait
dont wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
mixed feelings was my opinion i was defending my insecurities
chillin my conscience next to a villain
compton made you believe success wasnt real
be honest none of us knew of a record deal
so as i peel through these lottery tickets
i see a harley davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
a tall nigga hopped out with jordans and a white tank top
he was top of the rap game we was the top of the block
so watch that black boy flyblack boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boymy mama didnt raise me up to be jealoushearted
like most of the winners call it
regardless of where you stay hold your head and continue marching
thats what she said but in my head i wanted to be like jordan
a boy touring the country with money from mic recording
the only way out the ghetto you know the stereotype
shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40
and shortly i got discouraged
like every time i walked to the corner had them guns bursting
nigga i was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
only one in a million will ever see better days
especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy
all these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
they all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
what am i to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
when 2 niggas making it out had never sounded logical
3 niggas making it out thats mission impossible
so i never believed the type of performance that i could do
i wasnt jealous cuz of the talents they got
i was terrified theyll be the last black boys to fly
out of comptonthank god
black boy fly watch that black boy flywhat money got to do with it
when i dont know the full definition of a rap image
im trapped inside the ghetto and i aint proud to admit it
institutionalized i keep runnin back for a visit
hol up get it back
i said im trapped inside the ghetto and i aint proud to admit it
institutionalized i could still kill me a nigga so whatif i was the president
id pay my mamas rent
free my homies and them
bulletproof my chevy doors
lay in the white house and get high lord

to witness the realest shit thats ever been told to man
i found myself losing focus at a sunday service
embarrassed so i started questioning god what is my purpose
he say to live the way he did thats all he want from me
spread the word and witness he rose on the first sunday
i said alright enthused that my lord gave a listen
i opened my bible and searched to be a better christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
but shit my life is so fucked up man i cant help but give in
im giving testimonies to strangers i never met
hopped on the pulpit and told em how i was truly blessed
felt like im free from all my sins when the service was over
walked out the church then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith againwhat am i gonna do gotta have faith
life is too much understood where is your faith
oh faaaaaaaith
all you need is the size of a mustard seedsingle black parent from compton raising children of four
thats four innocent bastards cause papa they dont know
her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
cant find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
her baby daddy aint bout shit that nigga aint bout shit
spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
she pray to god every night hoping that hell mature
and maybe one day his kids something that hell live for
baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
because its hard tryna pay the bills when youre by yourself
she thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice
that said the devil is a lie make a better choice
and so its back to mcdonalds and every month dealing
with them crazy ass people at the county building
looked to the heavens and asked em to make a better way
then got a letter in the mail lost her section 8
then lost her faith againkendrick i appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
this about how faith works yeah murk it
i had dreams of holding a ninemilla to raise killa
ask him why as my eyes fill up
each day it gets more realer orangutans bang like gorillas
its jungle when the niggas ensue
the rats lurking vultures circling the serpents
cats lying through they teeth my nigga didnt deserve it
i flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
to make karma come faster than she normally will
its ill to see my faith try and leave me
its so hard to get it to get rid of it is easy
im tryna reach cloud nine thats what my niggas bout
but it never rain in california less them pistols out
until then my feet planted on the ground
shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
and if i get no answer just know i tried
i should have never looked into his sons eyes
ray charles voicethis for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
your minds slipping wondering is there really a god
knowing you shouldnt think that way and tryna freeze your brain
but whenever its pain that feeling forever remains
we cant believe what we cant see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life and now you live in a wheelchair
and your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of twelve and you feel that no one cares
searching for answers thats human nature you aint in the wrong
just know when you feeling that way his spirits in the room
i watched people i know pray and catch the holy ghost
and wonder why i aint never caught that feeling before
maybe they know him better or i dont know no better
but what i do know is that hes real and he lives forever
so the next time you feel like your worlds about to end
i hope you studied because hes testing your faith againhow much a dollar really cost
the question is detrimental paralyzin my thoughts
parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling yall
gotta see how im chillin once i park this luxury car
hopping out feeling big as mutombo
20 on pump 6 dirty marcellus called me dumbo
20 years ago cant forget
now i can lend all my ear or two
how to stack these residuals tenfold
the liberal concept of what menll do
20 on 6 he didnt hear me
indigenous african only spoke zulu
my american tongue was slurry
walked out the gas station
a homeless man with a semitan complexion
asked me for ten rand stressin about dry land
deep water powder blue skies that crack open
a piece of crack that he wanted i knew he was smokin
he begged and pleaded
asked me to feed him twice i didnt believe it
told him beat it
contributin money just for his pipe i couldnt see it
he said my son temptation is one thing that ive defeated
listen to me i want a single bill from you
nothin less nothin more
i told him i aint have it and closed my door
tell me how much a dollar costits more to feed your mind
water sun and love the one you love
all you need the air you breathehes starin at me in disbelief
my temper is buildin hes starin at me i grab my key
hes starin at me i started the car then i tried to leave
and somethin told me to keep it in park until i could see
the reason why he was mad at a stranger
like i was supposed to save him
like im the reason hes homeless and askin me for a favor
hes starin at me his eyes followed me with no laser
hes starin at me i notice that his stare is contagious
cause now im starin back at him feelin some type of disrespect
if i could throw a bat at him itd be aimin at his neck
i never understood someone beggin for goods
askin for handouts takin it if they could
and this particular person just had it down pat
starin at me for the longest until he finally asked
have you ever opened up exodus 14
a humble man is all that we ever need
tell me how much a dollar costits more to feed your mind
water sun and love the one you love
all you need the air you breatheguilt trippin and feelin resentment
i never met a transient that demanded attention
they got me frustrated indecisive and power trippin
sour emotions got me lookin at the universe different
i should distance myself i should keep it relentless
my selfishness is what got me here who the fuck im kiddin
so imma tell you like i told the last bum

i looked at him and said every nickel is mines to keep
he looked at me and said know the truth itll set you free

and that was bullshit i mean your life is full of turmoil
spoiled by fantasies of who you are i feel bad for you
i can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin you

finding me by myself promise me you can help
in all honesty i got time to be copacetic until
you had finally made decision to hold me against my will
it was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
i can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
every time you clock in the morning i feel you just want to kill
all my innocence while ignoring my purpose to persevere as a better person
i know you heard this and probably in fear
but what am i supposed to do with the blinking of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
and you ask lift up your shirt cause you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files but that dont matter because the matter is racial profile
i heard them chatter hes probably young but i know that hes down
step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
he dont mind he know well never respect the good kid maad citymass hallucination baby
ill education baby

when violence is the rhythm inspired me to obtain
the silence in this room with 20s xannies and shrooms
some grownup candy i lost it i feel its nothing to lose
the streets sure to release the worst side of my best

cant stand the way they slam todays gifted

this jam will lay scripted
deaf and impeccable
write a rhyme and i put everything in a flow

when a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
by the times itll be better leave it in the sto
cause they wrote nothin but lies quotes stuck in my eyes

grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
thats the feelin i get when youre concentratin
on this pen on this pad
