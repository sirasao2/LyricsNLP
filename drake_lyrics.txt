i cant even capture the feeling i had at first
meetin all my heroes like seein how magic works
the people i look up to are goin from bad to worse
their actions out of character even when they rehearse
workin in the land of the free the home of the brave
i gotta bring my brothers or else i feel out of place
breakin speed records on roads that these niggas paved
and they dont like that its written all on they face
i dont know how ima make it out of here clean
cant even keep track of who plays for the other team
iconic duos rip and split at the seams
goodhearted people are takin it to extremes

you ohh
ayemissin out on my years
theres times when i wish i was where i was
back when i used to wish i was here
missin out on my days
scrollin through life and fishin for praise
opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
im tryna see whos there on the other end of the shade
most times its just somebody thats underage
thats probably just alone and afraid
and lashin out so that someone else can feel they pain
i always hear people complain about the place that they live
that all the people here fake and they got nothin to give
cause they been starin at somebody elses version of shi
that makes another city seem more excitin than it is
i know a girl whose one goal was to visit rome
then she finally got to rome
and all she did was post pictures for people at home
cause all that mattered was impressin everybody shes known
i know another girl thats cryin out for help
but her latest caption is leave me alone
i know a girl happily married til she puts down her phone
i know a girl that saves pictures from places shes flown
to post later and make it look like she still on the go
look at the way we live
i wasnt hidin my kid from the world
i was hidin the world from my kid
from empty souls who just wake up and look to debate

thats why you trust me i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you what are you what are you so afraid ofdarling you you give but you cannot take lovei needed to hear that shit i hate when youre submissive
passive aggressive when were texting i feel the distance
i look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping
i like when money makes a difference but dont make you different
started realizing a couple places i could take it
i want to get back to when i was that kid in the basement
i want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation
and influence a generation thats lacking in patience
ive been dealing with my dad speaking of lack of patience
just me and my old man getting back to basics
weve been talking bout the future and time that we wasted
when he put that bottle down girl that niggas amazing
well fuck it we had a couple nas
we might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us
we even talked about you and our couple of moments
he said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
you a flower child beautiful child im in your zone
looking like you came from the 70s on your own
my mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone
you dont even know what you want from love anymore
i search for something im missing and disappear when im boredbut girl what qualities was i looking for before
who you settling for who better for you than the boy huhthinking bout texas back when porscha used to work at treasures
or further back than that before i had the houston leverage
when i got summer a michael kors with my mommas debit
a weak attempt at flexing ill never forget it
cause that night i played her three songs
then we got to talking bout something we disagreed on
then she start telling me how ill never be as big as trey songz
boy was she wrong that was just negative energy for me to feed off
now its therapeutic blowing money in the galleria
or beverly center macys where i discovered bria
landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
when i could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
the one that i needed was courtney from hooters on peachtree
ive always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
now she engaged to be married whats the rush on commitment
know we were going through some shit name a couple that isnt
remember our talk in the parking lot at the ritz
girl i felt like we had it all planned out i guess i fucked up the vision
learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
when you find out how im living i just hope im forgiven
it seem like you dont want this love anymoreim acting out in the open its hard for you to ignore
but girl what qualities was i looking for before
who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh
